                        After talking about the history and compilers it is time to make our first program. We like to make C programs under Linux, so we will use a text editor and the gnu compiler. But all programs we make in these tutorials will also work under Windows. Remember, the examples included in the C and C++ tutorials are all console programs. That means they use text to communicate. All compilers support the compilation of console programs. Check the userâ€™s manual of your compiler for more info on how to compile them. (It is not doable for us to write this down for every compiler).

                    </p>

                        The printf is used for printing things on the screen, in this case the words: Hello World. As you can see the data that is to be printed is put inside round brackets. The words Hello World are inside inverted ommas, because they are what is called a string. (A single letter is called a character and a series of characters is called a string). Strings must always be put between inverted commas. The \n is called an escape sequence. In this case it represents a newline character. After printing something to the screen you usually want to print something on the next line. If there is no \n then a next printf command will print the string on the same line.

                <div class="col-md-6" style="background-color: red; box-shadow: inset 1px 1px blue, inset 1px 1px blue; ">
                    <p>The Hello World program is a small program that is easy to understand. But a program can contain thousands of lines of code and can be so complex that it is hard for us to understand. To make our lives easier it is possible to write an explanation or comment in a program. This makes it much easier to understand the code. (Even if you did not look at the code for years).These comments will be ignored by the compiler at compilation time.</p>

                    <p>As you can see the printf and return statements have been indented or moved to the right side. This is
                        done to make the code more readable. In a program as Hello World, it seems a stupid thing to do. But as the programs become more complex, you will see that it makes the code more readable.

                        So, always use indentations and comments to make the code more readable. It will make your life much easier if the code becomes more complex.</p>
