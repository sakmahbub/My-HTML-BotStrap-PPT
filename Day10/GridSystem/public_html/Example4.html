                    <p>The printf is used for printing things on the screen, in this case the words: Hello World. As you can see the data that is to be printed is put inside round brackets. The words Hello World are inside inverted ommas, because they are what is called a string. (A single letter is called a character and a series of characters is called a string). Strings must always be put between inverted commas. The \n is called an escape sequence. In this case it represents a newline character. After printing something to the screen you usually want to print something on the next line. If there is no \n then a next printf command will print the string on the same line.</p>
