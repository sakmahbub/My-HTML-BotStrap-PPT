		<h1 style="color:red;">Project benefit management</h1>
		<h2 style="color:blue;">formulation and appraisal of target benefits</h2>
		<h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
<p>The project management literature is focused on efficient delivery of outputs (artifacts such as a bridge). While this approach is essential, project management methodologies, which focus only on efficient delivery of outputs neglect the importance of project benefit realization.</p>

		<h1><b>The Quality of Target Benefits Domain</b></h1>
		<p>Churchill suggested that specifying the domain should be the first step in developing a new construct. Because QTB is a quality-related construct, we first looked at the quality management literature to find that though commonly used, the term “quality” is not consistently defined. Examples of its definition include excellence, value, conformance to specifications, and meeting expectations (Reeves & Bednar, 1994). In this paper, building upon Crosby (1979), we operationalize quality as “conformance to specifications,” as such definition provides an objective basis for the initial assessment of formulated target benefits and allows their monitoring and evaluation. For example, when changes are made to the formulated target benefits during the project life, the quality of the revised target benefits can still be assessed against the same set of specifications. The remainder of this section aims to establish such a set of specifications.</p>
	
		<h1><b>Research Overview</b></h1>
		<p>Our research approach consists of:<br/> (1) specifying the domain of the construct<br/> (2) item generation and content validity<br/> (3) initial item reduction.</p>
